I'm Juan, I live in Sydney. I use this site to try tech, ideas and methods in a live environment. The content here often disappears.

[If you're after my professional info please head here.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juangc/)

I migrated from Colombia to Australia as an 18 year old in 2005, and completed a double major in Economics & Finance from UNSW in 2009.

I've been working in marketing for the last several years (in-house, agency side as well as an independent consultant for companies like Cadence Capital, Loftus Peak, ING Direct, several startups and even a politician).

I have hands-on experience in all aspects of digital marketing and have developed a deep expertise in digital ads. I've managed millions of dollars in Facebook and Google AdWords ad campaigns for businesses of different shapes and sizes.

If you're here you probably already know something about me or we have a mutual relationship... so here's something new.

### A slice of a story

As an international student, I had the obligation to pay for my university tuition fees up-front without any government support.

I come from a lower-middle income Colombian family which couldn't afford UNSW's fees (~$20K-$25K a year)

I got there, or here if you like, through hard work, grit, determination, people skills, taking risks and thinking laterally.

After uni I got sponsored by a business, and I eventually became an Australian citizen in 2016.

Gaining a degree and becoming Australian was a decade long, against-all-odds journey for me.

I put everything on the table to get where I wanted to be: Here.

### So why am I telling you any of this?

I'm trying to convey the kind of person I am.

When my family said "we can't pay $12,000 for 12 weeks of uni, much less do that twice a year!" I thought "I'll work it out".

-   When friends said "you just can't make enough money to pay for uni, you're only allowed to work 20 hours a week on a student visa" I thought "...I can work that out".
-   When my colleagues said "you can't get sponsored", when immigration said "you have to be on this list", when my teachers said "your grades aren't good enough"...

I worked it out.

Instead of telling you what clients I've worked with and what teams I've been a part of, info which is freely available on [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juangc), I hope I gave you a much better idea of the kind of person you'd be dealing with.
